# PINN-LB-TSE
This repository contains Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) codes implemented in TensorFlow 1 (version 1.15) to reproduce the Traffic State Estimation (TSE) experiment results presented in Section 6 of the paper:

	- Parameter Estimation and Adaptive Solution of the Leray-Burgers Equation using Physics-Informed Neural Networks.

# Code and Data Source
The code and  data for traffic state estimations generated by A. J. Huang and S. Agarwal are available at [https://github.com/arjhuang/pise](https://github.com/arjhuang/pise).
